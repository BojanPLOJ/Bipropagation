# Bipropagation
This is a Demo App in Python/TensorFlow of Bipropagation - a new Deep Learning algorithm.
This algorithm is an upgrade of the Backpropagation, which is 25 times faster and much more reliable (near 100%).
BipropagationXOR.py is written for TensorFlow version 0.9, BipropagationXOR1.py is written for TensorFlow version 1.0. 
Python is in both cases version 3.5.
